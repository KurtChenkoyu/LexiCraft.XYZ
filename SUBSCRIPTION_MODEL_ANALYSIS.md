# Subscription Model Analysis for LexiCraft

**Status:** 🟡 **Under Consideration**  
**Current Model:** Deposit-based (8-10% platform fee)  
**Question:** Should we add subscription or replace deposit model?

---

## 📊 Model Comparison

### Option 1: Deposit Model (Current)

**How it works:**
```
Parent deposits NT$1,000
  ↓
Child learns vocabulary
  ↓
Child earns NT$900 (90% returned)
  ↓
Platform keeps NT$100 (10% fee)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Parents see it as "investment" not "cost"
- ✅ Aligns with value proposition (kids earn money back)
- ✅ Transparent fee structure
- ✅ No recurring commitment (lower barrier to entry)
- ✅ Child gets 90% of earnings (strong incentive)
- ✅ High gross margin (80-90%+)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ One-time payment (lower LTV potential)
- ⚠️ Requires deposits to continue learning
- ⚠️ Less predictable revenue (depends on deposit frequency)
- ⚠️ Higher customer acquisition cost (need to convince to deposit)

**Revenue:**
- NT$1,000 deposit × 10% = **NT$100 per deposit**
- Average 2-3 deposits/year = **NT$200-300/year per family**

---

### Option 2: Subscription Model

**How it works:**
```
Parent subscribes NT$299/month
  ↓
Child learns vocabulary
  ↓
Child earns points (converted to NT$)
  ↓
Parent withdraws earned points
  ↓
Platform keeps subscription fee
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Predictable recurring revenue (MRR)
- ✅ Higher LTV potential (if retention is good)
- ✅ Lower barrier to entry (smaller monthly payment)
- ✅ Better for investors (recurring revenue is valued higher)
- ✅ Easier to budget for parents (monthly vs. large deposit)
- ✅ Can offer "unlimited" learning (no deposit limits)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Changes value proposition (less "investment" feel)
- ⚠️ May reduce child motivation (no "earned money" feeling)
- ⚠️ Churn risk (monthly cancellations)
- ⚠️ Lower per-transaction revenue (NT$299 vs NT$100 fee)
- ⚠️ Need to justify monthly cost (what's included?)

**Revenue:**
- NT$299/month × 12 months = **NT$3,588/year per family**
- If 80% retention: **NT$2,870/year per family**

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Model (Recommended)

**How it works:**
```
Option A: Subscription (NT$299/month)
  - Unlimited learning
  - Child earns points (converted to NT$)
  - Parent withdraws earned points
  - Platform keeps subscription fee

Option B: Deposit (NT$1,000 one-time)
  - Deposit-based learning
  - Child earns 90% back
  - Platform keeps 10% fee
  - Lower cost for occasional learners
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Appeals to different customer segments
- ✅ Higher total addressable market
- ✅ Can upsell subscription to deposit users
- ✅ Can downgrade subscription to deposit

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More complex to explain
- ⚠️ Need to manage two pricing models
- ⚠️ Potential cannibalization

```
1,000 families × NT$299/month × 12 months × 80% retention
= NT$2,870,400/year

### Subscription Model Value Prop

**For Parents:**

## 🚀 Hybrid Model: Best of Both Worlds

### Recommended Approach

**Offer both options:**

1. **Subscription Plan** (NT$299/month)
   - For committed learners
   - Unlimited learning

2. **Deposit Plan** (NT$1,000 one-time)
   - For occasional learners
   - Lower barrier (one-time payment)
   - "Investment" feel
   - Can convert to subscription later

### Conversion Strategy

**Deposit → Subscription:**
- After 2-3 deposits, offer subscription
- "Save 20% with monthly subscription"
- "Unlimited learning for less than 3 deposits/year"

**Subscription → Deposit:**
- If subscription churns, offer deposit option
- "Try deposit model - no monthly commitment"
- "90% of deposit goes back to your child"
