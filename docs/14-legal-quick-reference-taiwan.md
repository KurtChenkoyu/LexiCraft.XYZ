# Legal Quick Reference: Taiwan - Critical Issues Only

## 🚨 Top 5 Critical Legal Issues

### 1. Age of Majority = 20 (Not 18!)

**Problem**: Children under 20 cannot legally enter contracts.

**Solution**: 
- Parent must be account owner
- Parent deposits funds
- Parent approves withdrawals
- Child uses platform but parent owns account

**Risk**: ⚠️ **HIGH** - Contracts with minors may be voidable.

---

### 2. Direct Game Currency Transfer = Violates ToS (NOT FOR MVP)

**Problem**: Roblox/Fortnite prohibit external currency transfers.  
**This is why we're using direct cash withdrawal for MVP instead.**

**For Future Phase 2 (if validated):**
- Use **gift card model** instead
- Parent deposits → Platform buys gift cards
- Hold gift cards until earned
- Deliver gift card codes to parent
- Parent redeems in child's gaming account

**Risk**: ⚠️ **HIGH** - Platform ToS violations can result in bans.  
**MVP Decision**: Skip game currency, use direct cash withdrawal.

---

### 3. Tax Reporting Required (NT$1,000+)

**Problem**: Rewards ≥NT$1,000 require ID; ≥NT$20,010 require 10% tax prepayment.

**Solution**:
- Track annual reward value per user
- Collect ID when threshold reached
- Withhold 10% tax for large rewards
- Obtain guardian consent for minors

**Risk**: ⚠️ **HIGH** - Tax non-compliance = criminal penalties.

---

### 4. FTC Reward Limits (NT$150M Annual Max)

**Problem**: Startups can only give NT$150M in prizes annually.

**Solution**:
- Start small (NT$500-1,000 deposits)
- Limit individual rewards
- Track annual totals
- Scale as sales increase

**Risk**: ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - FTC fines for violations.

---

### 5. 7-Day Refund Right (Consumer Protection Act)

**Problem**: Consumers can cancel within 7 days for full refund.

**Solution**:
- Implement 7-day cooling-off period
- Process refunds automatically
- Clearly disclose in terms

**Risk**: ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Consumer complaints and regulatory action.

## ✅ Recommended Business Model

### Gift Card Model (Simplest Compliance)

```
1. Parent deposits NT$1,000
2. Platform purchases game currency gift cards (Future Phase 2 only - NOT MVP)
3. Child learns vocabulary
4. Child earns points
5. Platform delivers gift card codes to parent
6. Parent redeems codes in child's gaming account
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No money transmission license needed
- ✅ Complies with platform ToS
