**Primary Revenue:** Platform fee (8-10% of deposits)

---

## 💰 How We Make Money

### Primary Revenue Stream: Platform Fee (60% of revenue)

**Model:**
```
Parent deposits NT$1,000
  ↓
Child learns vocabulary
  ↓
Child earns points (e.g., 900 points = NT$900)
  ↓
Parent withdraws NT$900
  ↓
Platform keeps NT$100 (10% fee)
```

**Example:**
- Parent deposits: **NT$1,000**
- Child earns: **NT$900** (90% returned)
- Platform fee: **NT$100** (10% kept)
- Platform margin: **10%**

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Parents see it as "investment" not "cost"
- ✅ Platform fee is transparent
- ✅ Child still gets 90% of their earnings
- ✅ Sustainable business model
