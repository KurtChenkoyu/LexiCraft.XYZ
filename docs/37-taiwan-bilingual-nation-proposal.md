## Cost Breakdown

### Base Calculation

| Component | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Taiwan Population (2024) | 23.5 million | Official estimate |
| Target Percentage | 30% | Government goal |
| Target Population | 7.05 million | People to reach |
| Senses per Person | 2,000 | Top English word senses |
| Cost per Sense | 1 TWD | Verification cost |
| **Total Cost** | **14.1 billion TWD** | **~$440M USD** |

### Per-Person Economics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Cost per Person | 2,000 TWD | ~$62 USD |
| Senses per Person | 2,000 | Top frequency words |
| Minimum Timeline | 100 days | At 20 words/day limit |
| Realistic Timeline | 6-12 months | With spaced repetition |
| Cost per Month | ~167-333 TWD | If spread over 6-12 months |

### Comparison to Education Budget

| Metric | Value | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Taiwan 2024 Education Budget | ~600 billion TWD | Baseline |
| LexiCraft Initiative (Total) | 14.1 billion TWD | 2.35% |
| LexiCraft Initiative (Annual) | 2.8-4.7 billion TWD | 0.47-0.78% |
| Cost per Student (Annual) | ~400-667 TWD | If 3-year rollout |

**Key Insight:** This represents approximately 2.3% of Taiwan's annual education budget if implemented over 3 years, or less than 1% if spread over 5 years.

## What "Verified Mastery" Means

### LexiCraft Verification System

LexiCraft's verification goes beyond simple testing:

1. **MCQ Verification**
   - 6-option multiple choice questions
   - 99.54% statistical confidence
   - Adaptive difficulty matching
   - 20-30 distractor pool per sense

2. **Spaced Repetition (FSRS/SM-2+)**
   - Initial verification: Day 1
   - First review: Day 3
   - Second review: Day 7
   - Subsequent reviews: Adaptive (14, 30, 60+ days)
   - Ensures long-term retention, not just short-term memorization

3. **Mastery Progression**
   - Learning → Familiar → Known → Mastered
   - Multiple verification cycles required
   - Anti-gaming measures (speed traps, daily limits)

4. **Deep Understanding Requirements**
   - Context-aware questions
   - Multiple meanings tested (polysemy)
   - Confusion pairs addressed (e.g., affect/effect)
   - Real-world usage examples

### Why This Matters

Unlike traditional vocabulary tests that measure recognition, LexiCraft verifies:
- **Recognition** (can identify the word)
- **Comprehension** (understands meaning in context)
- **Retention** (remembers after days/weeks)
- **Application** (can distinguish from similar words)

- Focus: Major cities (Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung)
- Goals:
  - Validate infrastructure at scale
  - Refine verification processes
  - Gather user feedback
  - Establish success metrics

**Year 2: Expansion Phase (Additional 10%)**
- Target: Additional 2.35 million people
- Cost: 4.7 billion TWD
- Focus: Secondary cities + Year 1 participants continue
- Goals:

## Cost Structure Analysis

### Current LexiCraft Model vs. Government Model

#### Current Model (B2C)
```
Parent deposits NT$1,000
  ↓
Child learns vocabulary
  ↓
Child earns points (90% of deposit)
  ↓
Platform fee (8-10%)
```

**Revenue per User:** ~100-200 TWD  
**Platform Margin:** 8-10%

#### Government Model (B2G)
```
Government pays 1 TWD per sense verified
  ↓
Student completes verification
  ↓
Platform provides verification service
  ↓
Platform margin: Minimal (public service)
```

**Revenue per User:** 2,000 TWD (2,000 senses × 1 TWD)  
**Platform Margin:** Must cover costs (potentially break-even or small margin)

### Break-Even Analysis

**Assumptions:**
- 2,000 TWD per person (2,000 senses × 1 TWD)
- Infrastructure: 1.15B TWD/year
- Personnel: 0.47-0.82B TWD/year
- Other: 0.3-0.4B TWD/year
- **Total Annual Operating:** 1.92-2.37B TWD/year

**Break-Even Calculation:**
- If 1 TWD/sense covers only verification costs: Need additional funding
- If 1 TWD/sense includes platform overhead: May be viable
- If government provides infrastructure support: More viable

**Recommendation:** Government should consider:
1. **Infrastructure subsidy** (separate from per-sense cost)
2. **Phased payment** (pay as verification completes, not upfront)
3. **Performance-based pricing** (bonus for high completion rates)

**Key Advantages:**
- ✅ Verified mastery (not just recognition)
- ✅ Systematic retention (spaced repetition)
- ✅ Scalable (digital platform)
- ✅ Cost-effective (2,000 TWD per person)
- ✅ Measurable outcomes (data-driven)

**Key Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Infrastructure costs (1-2B TWD/year)
- ⚠️ Phased rollout recommended (3-5 years)
- ⚠️ Quality assurance critical at scale
- ⚠️ Integration with existing education system

**Recommendation:** Proceed with a **pilot program** (5% of population, 1.175M people, 2.35B TWD) to validate the model before full-scale implementation.
